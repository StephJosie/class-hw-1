# Class Refraction
## Description
This project was developed to aid in the learing of refraction.  The goal of this project was to make our given website more accessible.
The accessibility rating was rather low on some portions, so background color and font resizing was applied.
Alt attributes were added to all pictures, including the picture used as the background.  Semantic HTML was also addedto help make the 
code eeasier to read.  I was able to further learn how to make a webpage more accessible to those with disabilities.
